    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    A popular and ultimate fave throughout the islands of Hawai'i.

<p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can Spam (original, low sodium, jalapeno, any flavor you prefer is perfect!)
        </li>
        <li>1 pot Sticky, white rice</li>
        <li>1-2 packs Roasted Seaweed (same type used for rolling sushi)</li>
        <li>Sushi roll mat OR musubi maker</li>
        <li>Small container with clean, warm/cool water for rolling process</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Slice canned spam length-wise into uniform 1/3 in. strips (or whatever width you prefer)</li>
    <li>Heat a pan on the stove. Once pan is warm enough, lay spam slices flat into pan</li>
    <li>Cook on medium until browned on both sides</li>
    <li>After cooking all spam slices, prep your counter by opening your seaweed packages. Fold and tear the seaweed according to the pre-made lines (usually the seaweed sheets are pre-made to tear easily into either 3 wide strips or 6 thin strips). Put aside</li>
    <li>Take one strip of seaweed and lay it on the counter. Take the rectangle frame piece of your musubi maker and lay it across the center of seaweed strip.</li>
    <li>Take some rice and scoop into musubi mold. Use the "press" piece of musubi maker to press the rice into a uniform shape with the mold.</li>
    <li>Take a piece of spam, lay it over the rice. (Optional: you can add another scoop of rice on the spam if you prefer, especially if your spam is sliced thicker)</li>
    <li>After pressing the food into the mold once more, keep the press piece over the layers and (while pushing the center press)start lifting the rectangular mold up and out.</li>
    <li>Take the center press piece off the rice-spam layers and wrap the seaweed strip around the layers to "secure" them. Dip your finger into water and wipe it across the end of the seaweed strip to seal it together.</li>
</ol>
